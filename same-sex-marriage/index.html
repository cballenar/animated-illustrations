              <p>States cannot keep same-sex couples from marrying and must recognize their unions, the Supreme Court says in a ruling that for months has been the focus of speculation. The decision was 5-4.</p>
              <p>Justice Anthony Kennedy, seen as a pivotal swing vote in the case, wrote the majority opinion. All four justices who voted against the ruling wrote their own dissenting opinions: Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito.</p>
              <p>"They ask for equal dignity in the eyes of the law," Kennedy wrote of same-sex couples in the case. "The Constitution grants them that right."</p>
              <p>Comparing the ruling to other landmark decisions, NPR's Nina Totenberg says, "This is probably right up there with <em>Brown v. Board of Education,</em> and <em>Roe v. Wade</em> &mdash; if you like it or hate it &mdash; and today, <em>Obergefell v. Hodges</em>. This was a historic moment."</p>

              <p><strong><strong>Update at 11:30 a.m. ET: 'Our Love Is Equal,' Obergefell Says</strong></strong></p>
              <p>Friday's ruling "affirms what millions across this country already know to be true in their hearts: our love is equal," says lead plaintiff Jim Obergefell, who challenged Ohio's ban on same-sex marriage.</p>
              <p>Obergefell continued, "the four words etched onto the front of the Supreme Court &mdash; 'equal justice under law' &mdash; apply to us, too."</p>
              <p>He filed suit because he wasn't allowed to put his name on his late husband John Arthur's death certificate after Arthur died from ALS. Holding a photograph of Arthur as he spoke Friday, Obergefell said, "No American should have to suffer that indignity."</p>
              <p>Obergefell has been <a href="http://www.bucyrustelegraphforum.com/story/news/local/2015/06/19/ohios-sex-marriage-plaintiff-hear-decision-live/28976655/">traveling from Cincinnati to Washington</a> every week, to be sure he would be in the court when a decision was announced in his case.</p>
